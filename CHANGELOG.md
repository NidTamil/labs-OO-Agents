# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims
to follow semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

- Docs: record the SunChaser v2.2 Task 13 targeted vulnerable-only diagnostic,
  its evidence limits, and the required preflight and provenance workflow.
- Breaking: custom CodeAct error formatters must implement
  `format(error, code=None, *, line_offset=0, max_error=None, tail_chars=None)`.
  Reduced legacy signatures are no longer supported.
- Breaking: sandboxed user-code failures are exposed as `SandboxExecutionError`;
  inspect `original_type`, `original_error`, and `diagnostic` for worker-side details.
- Add composable, context-scoped instrumentation hooks and trace-session scopes so hosts can observe NOOA execution without replacing native tracing.
- Initial public release of NVIDIA Object-Oriented Agents (NOOA).
- Security: MCP server configurations no longer expand host environment variables
  from `${VAR}` placeholders. Trusted caller code must resolve secrets and pass
  their values explicitly.
- Fixed: generator agent methods (`def`/`async def` containing `yield`) are now
  traced correctly. Their span previously covered only the *creation* of the
  generator, so LLM calls made by the body were recorded as children of whichever
  method drained it. Body calls now nest under the generator, and calls the
  consumer makes between yields do not.
- Breaking: a generator method with the `...` generation marker (including
  `yield ...`) now raises `TypeError` at class-creation time. Generation
  strategies commit one final result and do not define a stream protocol.
  Deterministic generators remain supported without `@strategy`.
